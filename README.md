## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olly, a software developer, designer and lover of the outdoors.
I've worked as a full-stack dev for 2 years, honing my skills in Node.js, Vue.js, React Native.


### How did it all start you ask?
My dissertation gave me a lead into what I love. I created a mobile app, using React Native, which helped children with autism learn via a technique called Social Stories.
